#PSY 441 Senior Capstone Reproducibility and Statistics Assignment

##Welcome

If you're a student in my PSY 441 class at [EOU](https://www.eou.edu/), congratulations.
You found the project that you need to fork, edit, and push back up to Github.

If you're anyone else, that's cool too. Hopefully there's something of interest here
for you.

You'll find everything you need to completely reproduce this assignment, except for
this README, in the data directory.

##Data Directory Contents

* **politics.csv** The file you'll need to complete the homework
assignment.

* **Generation.Rmd** The file I used to create the data file.
The data were generated in a fully reproducible way, so if you process Generation.Rmd on your own
computer, you should be able to regenerate the file for yourself.

* **Example.Rmd** A model for the homework assignment you'll
need to complete. In it, I'll perform a number of the analyses and create the figures that you'll see
later in this text. The primary difference between what you'll see in this text and what you'll see
in the Example.Rmd file is that I walk you through things here, but I won't there.

* **Homework.Rmd** The file you'll need to fill in to successfully complete the assignment before
syncing it to your \href{https://github.com/knappsych/capstone-reproducibility}{fork of my project}.
Homework.Rmd is bare bones, so I strongly recommend referring to Example.Rmd as you work through the
problems.

* **Codebook.Rmd** A file that explains what the variables
in the data set are. You don't need to do anything to this file for this assignment, but it will be
useful to use it as a template for the data for your own study in completing your capstone project.

* **Reproducibility.pdf** The instructions / tutorial to complete the assignment.

* **Reproducibility.Rnw** The file that was used to create Reproducibility.pdf
inside RStudio. If you want to try for yourself, go for it, but you'll have to install LaTeX on your
computer.

* **imgs** A directory including all the images for this text.
